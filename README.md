# du-work-day-scheduler

## Description 
For this project I created a weekday scheduler that allowed a client to plan out their day. This will be perfect for planning out a busy business workday. It will display the time blocks 9am-5pm and the time blocks will be color coded for past, present, or future. In addition, the user will be able to add their events into each time block's text area and save it using a save button.
